This is a computer model of pluarlistic ignorance.
It has the ability to simulate simple social interactio in a way that displays 
the occurance of pluarlitic ignorace.

To run the Graphic User Interface you must download JAVA 11.0.2 
(Other versions may also work)

Then open command line in the Pluarlistic-Ignorance folder and run:
cd .\out\production\Pluralistic-Ignorance\
java Display


It is also possible to interact with the model without the GUI to run large
numbers of simulations.

For that you need to understand the API in Environment.java and edit it's main function

You can also look at the data I found from the model and formated in the data folder

If you have any questions about the model contact me at connor.g.hay@gmail.com

chayboilermaker is another github account that I created and accidently commit from but all the
code was written by me - connor
