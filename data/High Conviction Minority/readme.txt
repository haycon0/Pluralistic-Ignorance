These files have the diffrently formated data from the trials where I ran the model with a 
high conviction minority belief and a lower conviction majority belief to see if mass
pluarlistic ignorance would occur at diffrent conviction levels.

The python files are to make the graphs and csv files

In these files a1 refers to the conviction of the minority and a2 the conviction of the majority.
This is used in the naming of many of these files
